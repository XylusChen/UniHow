","The National University of Singapore Faculty of Law is widely regarded as Asia’s leading law school. Staffed by an outstanding permanent faculty diverse in origin and qualifications, NUS Law is dedicated to building a vibrant community and creating an environment that facilitates critical thinking and reflection on the fundamental legal issues confronting our interconnected world.

Located in Singapore, which for more than a century has been a commercial hub at the crossroads of Asia, NUS Law is very much Asia’s Global Law School. Since 1957 our curriculum has been infused with perspectives from other jurisdictions and disciplines. This tradition has accelerated in recent years, providing a legal education that is comparative, international, and multi-disciplinary. The Law School hosts many visiting faculty and students from every continent, offering a lively, cosmopolitan atmosphere both inside and outside the classroom.

The strength of the NUS Law curriculum lies in the broad and diverse range of subjects it offers. In addition to a rigorous core curriculum, students can choose electives in areas ranging from Asian legal studies to banking and finance, from public international law to intellectual property, or from arbitration to jurisprudence. The aim is to provide a liberal education that enables our graduates to think critically and creatively, as globally-oriented lawyers with a strong sense of their role in society.

Global, regional, and uniquely Singaporean perspectives on legal issues are all evident in the research produced by our faculty. The professors at NUS Law are not only engaged in a constant search for better legal solutions to the issues that confront all societies, but are also continually challenging accepted wisdom and conventional norms by raising new questions and problems to be confronted. Their work stretches across all aspects of law and appears in the most prestigious journals as well as books published by leading university presses around the world.

Singapore is an ideal place to study or research law, with excellent facilities and infrastructure, cutting edge legal work, and exceptional faculty and students.

","Pharmacy has been inseparable from mankind’s history since it fulfils one of our most basic needs. As man made his way through remote times or places, he reached out, often blindly, towards the resources of nature for cures and remedies of diseases and in the process gradually developed pharmaceutical theories, techniques and implements. The person supplying this essential service is known as a Pharmacist in modern times though he has been designated in a variety of ways throughout the ages.

Pharmacy is a profession concerned with an applied science of preparing from natural and synthetic sources suitable and convenient materials for distribution and use in the treatment and prevention of diseases. The applied science is firmly rooted in physical, chemical and biological sciences. It embraces a knowledge of the identification, selection, pharmacological action, preservation, combination, analysis and standardisation of medicines and their proper and safe distribution and use. A specialist in medications and the outcomes of their use on the healthy and sick must have a broad scientific education. The Pharmacy course is designed to give the student a solid groundwork in the relevant sciences.
","Inspirational life-affirming music-making is at the heart of the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (YST Conservatory) at the National University of Singapore. Centred in one of the world’s most dynamic countries, the Conservatory is uniquely placed to offer a distinct and powerful contemporary Asian voice.

Founded in 2003, YST quickly established a reputation as Asia’s most exciting international conservatory by bringing together a world-class faculty and facility to develop excellence in instrumental performance and composition. Building on this strong foundation, the Conservatory has evolved over the past decade to become one of the world’s most distinctive music schools through diversifying its offerings and connecting more authentically with its surrounding community. Specialisations added subsequently include Voice, Audio Arts & Sciences, Conducting, Music & Society and Music, Collaboration & Production. Alongside students from Singapore, the Conservatory community is internationally diverse, with representation from over 20 countries and five continents.

Keenly focused on nurturing identity as a driver for excellence, YST’s Bachelor of Music programme originally formed its core focus. The Conservatory’s continuum of offerings has since expanded substantially to include a Master of Music degree, NUS-facing Second Majors, Minor and modules, Continuing Education & Training (CET) courses for adult learners, and a Young Artist programme, with the ambition to reach further into the University to establish linkages with other performing and creative arts. More broadly, the Conservatory’s extensive concerts and events calendar welcomes the wider public to engage in music.

Major gifts from the Yong Loo Lin Trust enable the Conservatory to offer full financial support for all its undergraduate students. Educational opportunities made possible by other donors include access to fine string instruments on generous loan from the Rin Collection. Through the Ong Teng Cheong Professorship in Music, the Conservatory has been able to engage eminent musicians such as Nobuko Imai, Paul Lewis, Shlomo Mintz, Jorma Panula, András Schiff, Masaaki Suzuki, and Gábor Takács-Nagy. Thanks to a range of other targeted gifts, our students can access funding to forge their own distinctive pathways through participating in international festivals, competitions and projects.

Beyond Singapore, YST holds many bilateral relationships with music schools around the world. It is active in numerous international music education alliances including the ConNext Network, Pacific Alliance of Music Schools and Southeast Asian Directors of Music, as well as holding associate membership in the European Association of Conservatoires (AEC). Alongside extensive student exchange partnerships, these relationships further enhance our work and energise our continued growth.

As part of one of the world’s most highly-ranked research-intensive universities, YST is also steadily building its presence in research. Faculty are engaged internationally as performers and composers as well as in a range of research and research-equivalent activity. The Conservatory has hosted several international symposia including Performers(‘) Present (four iterations since 2009) and Mathemusical Conversations (2015), providing a gathering place as well as presentation and publishing platform for Conservatory and international scholars alike.

With excellence, inclusion, community, agency and identity as key drivers, the Conservatory seeks to nurture aspirant professional musicians while giving greater musical resonance in the broader ecosystem. Holding “Listen in New Light” as a core guiding principle connecting its past, present and future endeavours, YST is well-positioned to lead change in music and higher music education in the 21st century, (re)imagining new possibilities as it continues to evolve a unique trajectory.
