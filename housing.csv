PH believes in reaching out to everyone, and for nobody to be left behind.

Together with three other residential colleges, CAPT is located within University Town and within close proximity to the wide range of learning, sports and performing arts facilities.

The College of Alice & Peter Tan is distinguished by its vision of helping students engage with the community within and outside of NUS, and encouraging them to apply their knowledge to address issues that are important to society. The College consciously weaves this theme of active citizenship and community engagement through its curriculum and other aspects of the student experience.

The University Town College Programme (UTCP) curriculum at CAPT is designed to help students become critical thinkers, articulate communicators, and individuals who can deal with complexity and uncertainty. In addition, through various informal learning activities, students have the opportunity to acquire a greater awareness of the diverse communities around us, develop empathy, leadership and organisational skills, and cultivate an informed view of issues relevant to society.

We believe that active citizenship in the context of an educational institution is fundamentally about being equipped for participation in society. Our hope is that the outcome of this living-learning programme will be the shaping of knowledge, skills and values needed to make a difference, and that ultimately our students will apply them when they graduate to work across a wide range of careers and professions.
","**Master’s Message**

The world is becoming increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. In order for us to make sense of the many constantly moving parts, and attempt at the best decisions based on rapidly changing information at hand, we need to have the ability to form a macro view of how the moving parts interact and effect a certain direction of change.

Indeed, we find that the traditional method of breaking complex problems down into manageable parts and attacking them separately may not be sufficient. The complexity of the problem often lies in the interconnectivity of the constituent parts – a change in one part causes other parts to move. This is why we often lament that “when one problem is fixed, another one pops up.”

At the same time, the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity of the world bring us stress. Here, another aspect of interconnectivity becomes important – the interconnectivity of a community of people. We all experience occasional low points, and we all need support from our family and friends in one way or another.

RC4 aims to help you thrive and become more resilient in the world.

RC4 provide a curriculum with a focus on “systems thinking”. We adopt an interdisciplinary and integrative approach that examines how complex problems in the world can be seen through the lens of a system, with the intertwined interconnectivity of its multiple parts. Let’s take healthcare as an example. Clearly, it is not just about medical sciences; economics, sociology, culture and belief systems, and human behaviour are equally important factors.

RC4 is also the home-away-from-home for our 600 residents. It is a close-knit living-and-learning community with a strong spirit of concern and care. In the College, students study together, egg each other on to become better “systems thinkers”, engage in various co-curricular interests together, discuss real world issues together, and support each other in times of need. At the same time, they are supported by a dedicated team of 5 Resident Fellows (who are academic staff teaching in the College), 15 Resident Assistants (who are senior students with assigned duties), as well as other teaching fellows, admin staff and housing staff.

At RC4, we believe every member of the community is important. The College is an interconnected whole. We share our joys and tears. Together, we strive for excellence.

","Tembusu College is one of four residential colleges at University Town (UTown), an extension of the main NUS campus at Kent Ridge. The colleges, the first of their kind in Singapore and Southeast Asia, provide an exciting alternative to undergraduate campus living.

In addition to co-curricular activities, *most incoming freshmen will take four of their classes at the College over a two year period, helping them fulfill part of their General Education requirements. Some students from non-modular faculties (whose course requirements may be reduced or waived), and students on semestral exchange programmes add to the residential mix. Students from any NUS faculty are eligible to apply.

Freshmen normally reside in Tembusu College for two years during which they complete our four-module schedule. Additionally, the College provides many opportunities for learning on a daily basis.

Faculty members and visiting scholars from prestigious overseas institutions also live at the College and take meals in the same dining hall as students. There are regular ‘Master’s Teas’ and other events at which small groups of students can interact with distinguished visitors in a relaxed, non-classroom setting.

Tembusu College students also enjoy easy access to a wide array of UTown facilities, and are invited to participate in a myriad of exciting sporting and social activities. The three buildings of the College house approximately 600 undergraduates, a small number of graduate student advisors, as well as Residential Fellows, their families, and distinguished guests. UTown is connected to the Kent Ridge campus by frequent shuttle buses and a pedestrian bridge. Many regular NUS classes, especially those for freshmen, also take place at UTown’s Education Resource Centre and the Stephen Riady Centre, both just opposite Tembusu College.","Nestled in a valley near the Kent Ridge MRT station, the PGP Residence (PGPR) beckons to all students who wish to live in a condominium-like hostel with air-conditioned rooms, lounges, study rooms, music rooms as well as sports facilities such as badminton, basketball, tennis courts and a gym.

This is not all that PGPR can offer you. Here are some of the other things you can look forward to there:

1. A diverse multicultural community with residents hailing from 68 countries (and counting).
2. Thematic programmes in areas such as Community Sports, Outdoor Adventure, Wellness, and Community Service (these programmes are open to all residents and are entirely optional).
3. Leadership opportunities to grow and serve as a Resident Assistant or a Cluster Leader (applications are open every semester).
4. Strong pastoral care from the residential staff and student leaders

You’ll never feel far from home!","UTown Residence, also known as UTR, is located in the heart of NUS University Town. It is the first of its kind in Singapore’s higher learning landscape where both undergraduate and graduate students live and learn in close proximity. The design of the residence emphasizes open common areas, and the architecture fosters a sense of community and cross-disciplinary discussion. UTR oversees the large Town Green, which is a big green space for students to gather, play sports or even have a picnic. UTR consists of the North and South Tower, which can house up to 1,700 residents.

UTown Residence is led by the Master, assisted by Resident Fellows (RFs) and Resident Assistants (RAs). They oversee the residential and student life through activities, welfare initiatives and engagements. The RFs also act as mentors, advisors and resource persons to the residents. Residents are encouraged to approach them with any problems they may have. ",
