"Thank you for using UniHow! :school::books::pencil:

Choosing a university degree is a big decision that is often life-changing. As a student fresh out of Junior College or Polytechnic, it is not always easy to decide what you want to specialize in, especially if you are unsure of your interests or options. This decision is made even more difficult if you plan to enter the National University of Singapore (NUS), a University offering programmes across a huge range of disciplines. 

UniHow aims to connect prospective students with current undergraduates, school alumni and professors. This will enable students to quickly, and conveniently engage in fruitful conversations with experienced seniors to discover more about University academic matters or just University life in general. Ultimately, students can make more informed decisions when choosing the right academic path for themselves, which they will less likely regret in the future. 

Our bot will offer anonymity to both parties so that conversations can be kept free and easy, which we believe can spark more meaningful discussions and inspirations. (Juniors don’t have to be shy of asking more personal questions while seniors will feel more comfortable sharing their personal experiences in University). Of course, both parties are free to exchange their contact information should they choose to continue the conversation and forge a deeper relationship. 

We are working hard to expand our bot’s functionalities so that all parties can also utilize it for more meaningful purposes such as sourcing for project group mates, building a research team or even to connect with school alumni regarding internship opportunities. 

Note: UniHow is still in it's development phase. We seek your understanding if you encounter any bugs while using our bot and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused. Do contact us @XylusChen or @jytheawesome if you encounter any issues with UniHow! Thank you and have a great day!"
