"NUS Double Degree Programmes (DDPs) allow students to graduate with two different degrees in two disciplines from the same Faculty/School or two different Faculties/Schools within NUS. A Double Degree allows some modules taken to be double counted towards the requirements of both degrees, thus enabling the student to complete the two degrees in a shorter period than it would take to complete both degrees separately. In general, a student in a DDP graduating with double Honours will require about five years of study, fulfilling at least 200 modular credits (MCs) to graduate. A student in a DDP with Honours in one discipline and a general degree in the other will require about four-and-a-half-years of study, fulfilling at least 180 MCs to graduate.

 Faculties/Schools have identified certain prohibited combinations for student-initiated DDPs. Hence, when putting together their own Double Degree combinations, students should always verify permissible combinations with their Home Faculties/Schools before embarking on one.","A Double Major is a single degree programme, in which a student satisfies the requirements of two Majors. It is conceived as an opportunity for students to broaden their knowledge and competencies by pursuing a second Major alongside their primary Major. The Second Major affords a degree of depth, although its modular credit (MC) requirement is set below that of the Major. The Second Major is a non-Honours major and may be taken in the same Faculty that offers the student’s Major or from a different Faculty.

Students can be admitted to Double Major Programmes at the point of admission to NUS, or by applying to the relevant Faculties/Schools no later than the end of the fifth semester of study. ","Concurrent degree programmes (CDPs) involve a combination of a Bachelor's and a Master's degree from the same Faculty or from two different Faculties. Such programmes allow a student to pursue a Bachelor's and a Master's degree concurrently. The programme structure allows some of the requirements for the Bachelor's degree to be also counted towards the Master's degree so that a student could graduate in four and a half to five years with both degrees, instead of five and a half to six years if pursued separately.

The Student Exchange Programme (SEP) is the largest and most established global programme in NUS. Through the development and management of strategic and sustainable partnerships with universities globally, Global Relations Office (GRO) strives to ensure a quality exchange experience for all outgoing and incoming students. More than 90% of both outgoing and incoming students are highly satisfied with their SEP experience. More than 95% of our overseas SEP alumni would recommend NUS to their peers at their home universities, while almost all returned SEP exchangers would gladly participate in SEP again if given the chance.

NUS students are able to choose from over 300 partner universities in more than 40 countries for their SEP experience. In AY 2017/18, approximately 2,000 NUS students embarked on SEP while close to 2,000 incoming students were received from our partner universities. We welcome students to participate in exchange to broaden their horizons and gain essential soft skills in preparation for the world after graduation.","The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme is all about providing you with the entrepreneurial experience that you need to start-up your own journey. Gain access to twelve global entrepreneurial hotspots, take on the role of an entrepreneur at innovative start-ups, while attending courses at our renowned partner universities. Be empowered with the know-how and skill sets you need to make a change in the world today!
","The University Scholars Programme (USP) is an undergraduate academic programme established in 2001 in the National University of Singapore (NUS). Each year, USP admits around 220 to 240 undergraduates from across seven faculties and schools in NUS.

The USP education focuses on strengthening core academic and professional skills – writing and critical thinking, analytical and quantitative reasoning, the ability to ask the right questions and pursue research, and the habit of reflecting upon ideas within a broad intellectual landscape. We do this through an intensive and rigorous multidisciplinary curriculum, and a rich offering of local and international programmes. Our focus on core skills complements our students’ strengths in their major disciplines, enabling them to make substantial connections across fields, enhancing their intellectual depth and breadth.

USP students reside in Cinnamon College at the NUS University Town. Alongside a vibrant student life, the residential college is a space for discussions on diverse issues, allowing our students to develop meaningful engagement with real world matters.

We invite you to learn more about USP, a place for reflecting on enduring deep ideas and searching out new intellectual connections. Of passion for exploration. Of synthesis, collaboration and responsibility. A place where students, professors and alumni form a diverse, forward-looking community that is curious, critical, courageous and engaged.







","The University Town College Programme (UTCP) is a two-year residential programme offered at College of Alice & Peter Tan, Residential College 4, and Tembusu College. Designed as a more coherent delivery of general education, the UTCP emphasises interdisciplinary and active small-group learning. Students from different disciplines, cultures and nationalities are put together in each class, which helps them to assimilate and synthesise cross-disciplinary knowledge, facilitating multi-perspectival thinking.
Through its interdisciplinary curriculum, the UTCP will help students develop effective communications and strong writing skills, critical thinking skills, and intellectual breadth and rigour to tackle the complex, inter-related challenges confronting the world today. A host of informal learning activities, such as talks by distinguished visitors, as well as social and sporting activities, complements the formal curriculum.

Admissions to the UTCP is typically reserved for incoming freshmen. Current undergraduates interested in joining the programme may contact their RC of choice for more information.","Launched in August 2014, Ridge View Residential College (RVRC) offers a living-learning experience aimed at cultivating students who are intellectually inquisitive, future-ready, and value-centric. If you are an incoming first year student from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS), Faculty of Engineering (FOE), Faculty of Science (FOS), School of Computing (SOC) and School of Design and Environment (SDE), we invite you to be a part of our exciting community that offers an integrated inter-disciplinary approach, anchored on the theme of sustainability. RVRC is a one year residency that offers an integrated inter-disciplinary approach anchored on the theme of sustainability. Students read three core modules over two semesters or one academic year, alongside modules in your own faculty/school. The RVRC programme not only helps develop competence in professional and academic communication but ensures students cultivate future-ready attributes through active engagement with industry through mentorship and dialogues.","Joint Degree programmes (JDP) with premier overseas universities provide students with further academic challenges and the opportunities to learn alongside other brilliant students in cross-cultural settings.

A JDP combines the strengths of both NUS and our partner university's curricula and integrate international experience fully into a student's course of study. Students will be jointly taught and assessed and jointly awarded a degree. The degree scroll bearing the crests and official signatories of both universities will be a doubly validated qualification. Students will be able to complete a JDP with Honours within four years if they follow the study plan.","There are part time programmes available for youths, undergraduates, and graduates. 
","A Minor programme is a coherent course of study in an additional area outside of the Major. Doing a Minor programme contributes to the breadth of learning envisaged for an NUS undergraduate education.

The Minor will be reflected in the student's transcript upon successful completion.

Students can be admitted to Minor programmes at the point of admission to NUS, or by applying/declaring to the relevant Faculties/Schools no later than the end of the fifth semester of study. "
