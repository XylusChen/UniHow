Hi! We are Xylus and Jay, computer science majors from the NUS School of Computing.

What is UniHow? 
UniHow is a user-friendly Telegram Bot created to help prospective students and fresh NUS undergraduates make better decisions with regards to their general university experience. 

What features are available in UniHow?

1) NUS Information Panel
It is often difficult to make sense of the large amount of information available online about NUS. The UniHow bot provides a one-stop solution where you can quickly find out basic information about NUS. This is much more beginner-friendly and will help kickstart your journey in finding out more about NUS. Hyperlinks to the official NUS website are provided as well if you require supplementary information. 

2) QnA Section
Have burning questions about NUS? Simply send in your question via the UniHow Bot! There are a total of 38 question categories so you can ask away about any aspect of life in NUS! Once a new question is posted, it will be broadcasted in our Question ChanneL, which can be viewed by other students, staff, and alumni, who are more experienced and better equipped to answer the question! Answers will then be broadcasted on an Answer channel for all to learn from! You may even search for specific content by browsing through  the channels using specific keywords. 

3) Live chat
Why not chat directly one on one with someone else about interesting topics regarding NUS? Match up with them via our live chat feature! Through this feature, you can make new friends and facilitate in-depth discussion! 

Why not give UniHow a try? We trust that it will greatly complement your University experience!
